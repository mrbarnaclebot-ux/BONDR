# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-19)

**Core value:** A holder can verify on the token page that the dev holds no launch supply, and see that pre-bond fees went to forcing the bond and burning supply, never to the dev.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Chain Spike

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Chain Spike)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-19 - Roadmap created (7 phases, 57/57 requirements mapped)

Progress: [----------] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phases follow the 7 PROJECT.md build steps in order, all in mvp mode.
- [Roadmap]: PLAT-03 (terms page) moved from Go-Live to Phase 2, because the Phase 2 consent prompt must link to and accept the terms.
- [Roadmap]: FEE-10 (W key derivation, worker only) is in Phase 2, because launch needs W as creator.
- [Roadmap]: PLAT-04 (responsive) is in Phase 2; every later UI phase keeps it via mobile, tablet and desktop screenshots.
- [Roadmap]: TOKEN-03 (burn budget, 24h window) is in Phase 5 with the fee engine that produces those values.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 is a hard gate: any spike step without a signature changes PROJECT.md before Phase 2.
- Phase 2: web must get each W pubkey without holding the master seed (FEE-10). The planner must decide how the worker supplies W pubkeys and vanity mint keys for the co-sign.
- Resolved 2026-10-19: Sentry (OPS-01) moved to Phase 2, so ADMIN-06 can read real issue counts in Phase 6.
- Phase 7: BONDR's own launch is a SOL pair at the standard creator fee, so the Phase 2 launch builder needs a SOL-quote path for it.
- Pump ships breaking changes on short notice; re-verify against pump-public-docs before each phase.
